# Data Professionals Survey Power BI Dashboard

##  Project Overview

This repository contains the final project for the [Your Name/Channel Name] Power BI Tutorial Series. The project involves building an interactive Power BI dashboard from a **real, raw dataset** collected from a survey of over 600 data professionals.

The focus was on the end-to-end process:
*   **Data Transformation:** Using Power Query to clean and shape the raw, messy survey data.
*   **Data Modeling:** Creating calculated columns and measures (like average salary).
*   **Data Visualization:** Building a cohesive and insightful dashboard with various chart types.
*   **Dashboard Design:** Applying a custom theme and layout for a polished, professional look.

##  Key Insights Explored

The dashboard provides insights into the data community, answering questions like:

*   What is the **average salary** by job title (Data Scientist, Analyst, Engineer, etc.)?
*   What is the most popular **programming language** among data professionals?
*   How does **salary and happiness** vary by **country**?
*   What is the overall **work-life balance** and **salary satisfaction**?
*   How **difficult** was it for professionals to break into the data field?
*   What is the **gender distribution** and its correlation with salary?

##  Tools & Technologies

*   **Microsoft Power BI:** For ETL, data modeling, and visualization.
*   **Power Query (M Language):** For data transformation and cleaning.
*   **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating calculated columns and measures.
*   **Git & GitHub:** For version control and project hosting.

##  How to Use This Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-professionals-survey-powerbi.git
    ```

2.  **Get the Data:**
    *   Download the `Power BI Final Project.xlsx` file from the source provided in the tutorial video.
    *   Place the Excel file inside the `Data/` folder in the cloned repository.

3.  **Open the Power BI File:**
    *   Navigate to the `Power_BI_File/` directory and open the `Data_Professional_Survey_Analysis.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
    *   If prompted, update the data source path to point to the Excel file in your local `Data/` folder.

4.  **Explore!** Interact with the filters and visuals to explore the insights for yourself.

##  Key Learnings & Skills Demonstrated

*   **Power Query Transformations:**
    *   Splitting columns by delimiters.
    *   Replacing values and handling text fields.
    *   Creating custom columns for calculations (e.g., average salary from a range).
    *   Changing data types.
*   **DAX & Data Modeling:**
    *   Creating calculated columns.
    *   Using basic aggregation functions (AVERAGE, COUNT).
*   **Data Visualization:**
    *   Utilizing various chart types: Bar/Column Charts, Treemaps, Gauges, Donut Charts, and Cards.
    *   Effective use of titles, legends, and tooltips.
    *   Creating an interactive dashboard where visuals cross-filter each other.
*   **Design & UX:**
    *   Applying and customizing Power BI themes.
    *   Strategic layout and alignment for a clean, professional presentation.

###  Suggestions for Further Analysis

This dataset has immense potential for deeper analysis. Some ideas:
*   Perform more advanced data cleaning (e.g., standardizing the "Other" job titles and countries).
*   Create more complex DAX measures for year-over-year growth or rankings.
*   Analyze correlation between salary and factors like country, job title, and programming language.
