# Data Professionals Survey Power BI Dashboard

##  Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard analyzing real survey data from over 600 data professionals. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data analysis:

*   **Data Transformation:** Using Power Query to clean and shape raw, messy survey data
*   **Data Modeling:** Creating calculated columns and measures (like average salary)
*   **Data Visualization:** Building an interactive dashboard with various chart types
*   **Dashboard Design:** Applying custom themes for a professional presentation

##  Key Insights Explored

The dashboard provides insights into the data community, answering questions like:

*   What is the **average salary** by job title (Data Scientist, Analyst, Engineer, etc.)?
*   What is the most popular **programming language** among data professionals?
*   How does **salary and happiness** vary by **country**?
*   What is the overall **work-life balance** and **salary satisfaction**?
*   How **difficult** was it for professionals to break into the data field?
*   What is the **gender distribution** and its correlation with salary?

##  Tools & Technologies

*   **Microsoft Power BI:** For ETL, data modeling, and visualization
*   **Power Query (M Language):** For data transformation and cleaning
*   **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating calculated columns and measures
*   **Git & GitHub:** For version control and project hosting

###  Suggestions for Further Analysis

This dataset has potential for deeper analysis:
*   Perform more advanced data cleaning (standardizing "Other" job titles and countries)
*   Create more complex DAX measures for rankings and correlations
*   Analyze relationships between salary and factors like country, job title, and programming language
